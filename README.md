Flexible Protocol for Targeted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis


Flexible Protocol for Targeted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis

The "Flexible Protocol for Targeted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis" (Coman et al. 2014) [Pubmed] presents a user-friendly workflow to perform targeted gene co-expression network analyses using large-scale gene expression data and explains critical steps from design and data analysis to prediction of functionally related modules.

Highlights:

    infers statistically significant gene co-expression networks
    uses quantitative data generated by RNA-seq, microarrays, RT-qPCR, proteomics etc. for any organism
    runs on various platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows)
    uses exclusively open source software (R, Cytoscape)
